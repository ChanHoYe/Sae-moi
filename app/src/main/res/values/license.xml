indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of

"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License, as
indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix
below).<br><br>
"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work
and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an

separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br><br>
"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or
additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the
Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner.
For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to
the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code

writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."<br><br>
"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received
by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.<br><br>
2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to
You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare
Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works
in Source or Object form.<br><br>
3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a
perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent
license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license
applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent
infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date
such litigation is filed.<br><br>
4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with
or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:<br><br>
You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br><br>
You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and<br>
You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the
Derivative Works; and<br>
If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute
must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that
do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file
distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the
Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices
normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You
may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the
NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the
License.<br><br>
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and
conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this
License.<br>
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for
inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any
additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any
separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br><br>
6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product
names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br><br>
7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and
each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either
express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of
using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this
License.<br><br>
8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or
otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing,
shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any
and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
damages.<br><br>
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose
to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights
consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your
sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each
Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your
accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br><br>
